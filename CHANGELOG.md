## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — first release

### Added
- `egf analyse` CLI command — full pipeline from corpus to HTML report
- Domain template system: `software-tool`, `philosophy`, `vehicle`, `genre`,
  `discipline`, `custom:<noun>` — controls LLM prompts, description guidance,
  and report labels throughout
- `--describe-format` flag — prints four-sentence description template for
  any domain and exits
- `--verbose` / `-v` flag — shows detailed per-step progress output
- `--open` flag — opens the HTML report in the default browser after generation
- Loader (`egf/loader.py`) — reads `.md`/`.txt` corpora with UTF-8 validation,
  size limits, and a minimum corpus size of 7 documents
- Embedder (`egf/embedder.py`) — wraps `sentence-transformers` with offline
  model caching and finite-value validation
- Reducer (`egf/reducer.py`) — UMAP reduction to 2D and 3D, deterministic
  seed, automatic n_neighbors clamping
- Quality assessment (`egf/quality.py`) — trustworthiness, continuity, LCMC;
  quality gate warning below configurable threshold
- Density estimation (`egf/density.py`) — k-NN radius density, grid
  interpolation, Gaussian smoothing
- Gap detection (`egf/gaps.py`) — local minima, non-maximum suppression,
  isolation scoring, `gaps.json` output
- Vocabulary projection (`egf/vocabulary.py`) — TF-IDF inverse projection
  from gap centroids to ranked term lists
- Ollama client (`egf/llm.py`) — domain-aware LLM prompts, health check,
  graceful fallback, never raises
- Candidate generation (`egf/candidates.py`) — vocabulary and LLM paths,
  confidence scoring, `generation_mode` tracking
- HTML report (`egf/report.py` + `egf/templates/report.html.j2`) — dark
  terminal aesthetic, Plotly interactive scatter map, candidate cards,
  saturation indicator, methodology note
- Demo corpora: datasculptures portfolio (software domain) and ten schools
  of Western philosophy (philosophy domain)
- PowerShell demo scripts: `run_demo_software.ps1`, `run_demo_philosophy.ps1`

### Implementation notes (spec-level fixes recorded across phases)
- Phase 2: `_continuity` self-reference bug fixed (sklearn `kneighbors` on
  training data returns the point itself; guarded with `n_neighbors=n` and
  empty-where check)
- Phase 2: `make_perfect_pair` test fixture corrected (signal-first embedding
  to ensure genuine topology preservation)
- Phase 2: `continuity` score clamped to `[0, 1]` to match sklearn convention
- Phase 3: `griddata method="nearest"` fallback when corpus has fewer than 3
  non-colinear points
- Phase 3: isolation threshold uses `>` not `>=` so 1.0 acts as the
  impossible sentinel
- Phase 3: `DensityResult` import moved to `TYPE_CHECKING` block (ruff TC001)
- Phase 4: `except Exception` widening in `llm.py` to honour "never raises"
  contract
- Phase 5: `list[dict[str, object]]` annotation for mypy strict compliance

### Dependencies
- `click`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `umap-learn`, `sentence-transformers`,
  `scipy`, `jinja2`, `plotly`, `httpx`
- `hdbscan` available as optional extra `[clustering]` — no prebuilt wheel
  for Python >= 3.13 on Windows at time of release

## [0.0.1] — scaffold

### Added
- Repository structure and pyproject.toml
- Ruff, mypy, pytest with coverage configured
- CI workflow (ubuntu-latest, Python 3.10 and 3.11)
- README stub and CHANGELOG
